# Digital Keyboard - CSCB58 Project
This project is an FPGA application on the Altera DE2-115 board that functions as a digital keyboard (piano) from keyboard and microphone input. It can play music using 3 lines of keyboard - 12345678, QWERTYUI, ASDFGHJK. The sounds will have 4 variations that can be changed using 2 switches. Also, the keyboard will contain BPM changeable metronome that keeps ticking while the metronome switch is turned on. The BPM will be displayed on the 7-segment display for users. The sound recorder will also be implemented two records while the record switch is turned on.

## Requirements
* Cyclone IV FPGA DE2 board
* Keyboard
* Sensor
