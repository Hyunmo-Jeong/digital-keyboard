Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Digital Keyboard


Provide a one paragraph description of your project: 

	This project is an FPGA application on the Altera DE2-115 board that 
	functions as a digital keyboard (piano) from keyboard and microphone input. 
	It can play music using 3 lines of keyboard - 12345678, QWERTYUI, ASDFGHJK. 
	The sounds will have 4 variations that can be changed using 2 switches. 
	Also, the keyboard will contain BPM changeable metronome that keeps ticking 
	while the metronome switch is turned on. The BPM will be displayed on the 
	7-segment display for users. The sound recorder will also be implemented 
	two records while the record switch is turned on.

What is your plan for the first week?

	We will be using keyboard to input the piano key and sensor to output the sound.

	We will design (draw schematics):
	- Piano
	- Flat-BPM (unchangeable) metronome
	- Sound recorder

	We will build:
	- Fixed-BPM metronome
	- Connect BPM with 7-segment display using hex_display module
	- Register for recording sound

	We will test:
	- Metronome
	- Piano
	  - Sound within three octaves
	- Metronome and piano together
	  - Both sound should be heard
	  - Piano volume should be larger

	We will research:
	- How to connect inputs and sounds 
	- 4 sound variations

	We will prepare:
	- Musics for test recorder
	
What is your plan for the second week?

	We will design (draw schematics):
	- BPM changeable metronome

	We will update:
	- Fixed-BPM metronome to changeable BPM metronome
	  - 4 variations
	- Sound recorder using register built last week

	We will test:
	- BPM changeable metronome
	  - Default BPM (fixed-BPM built last week)
	  - 4 different variations
	- Metronome and piano together
	  - Both sound should be heard
	  - Piano volume should be larger
	- Sound recorder

	We will research:
	- How to store two or more sound memory in DE2 board

	We will prepare:
	- Musics for test recorder

What is your plan for the third week?
	
	We will update:
	- Sound recorder record two or more musics

	We will test:
	- Sound recorder
	  - Use metronome and piano with music prepared last week

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?

	1) Make sound recorder that can record once and overwrite.	
	2) Make fixed-BPM (unchangeable) metronome.
	   Display the fixed-BPM on 7-segment display.
	3) Change the input from keyboard into switches.


Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>


[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1: 
	We added and tested the sensors and the main FSM. 
	The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead.
	Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the high score feature. We have updated that in the project description as an optional feature.
